     <p class="paragraph2"> My name is Georgiana! I am 19 years old Romanian girl. I am studying Multimedia design and communication at KEA, School of Design and Technology. I love to tell stories and I call myself an emotional narrator who loves to travel, write and take pictures. Maybe for the beginning I should tell you a little story about how I have started to study at this program. When I was a little kid I have never had an answer to the question " What do you want to be when you grow up? " because I have not been that kind of child who dreams of becoming a doctor, a lawyer or a policeman. I have always enjoyed doing things in a different way than those of my age, around me. I think the success is a matter of perspective. </p>
